Gradia is a homebrew setting for fantasy role-playing games that started with the release of Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition in 2000, as a simple map of two nations, Narin and Corin. Gradia has grown organically and collaboratively with the help of GMs and players alike ever since.Gradia is a very human-focused world. And, with some notable exceptions, it's a fairly low-fantasy world as well. Orcs, Elves, magic and monsters exist - but most people have never seen anything magical, let alone ever having met a wizard. Gods do grant their most devout followers powers akin to minor miracles, but the common believers never have such experiences.That's not to say that Gradia is a mundane world, though! Epic-worthy adventures await those willing to look beyond the surface. Diverse cultures co-exist while nations rise and fall and vie for power around them. How will you shape the course of this land's history?Tags to explore:  Pages to start with:Religions, locations, Timeline
