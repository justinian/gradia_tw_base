Kmekh /ˈkmeχ/

Stout, dense, and strong, the Kmekh peoples of Gradia generally stand between four and five feet in height, with a stockier build than humans or halflings. Kmekh hair colors are mostly similar to those of humans, though their hair tends to turn grey or white much earlier in their lifespans than other humanoids.

Kmekh mostly dwell in their vast underground mountain cities in the Rookspine Mountains known as the Nauglimir. Not nearly as insular and single-minded as they are stereotyped to be, the Kmekh are just as likely to wander and seek knowledge as any other race - they're just also better at doing it underground than most other races. The Kmekh are also said to be innate craftsmen, but the reality is that their culture values hard work and craftsmanship, and such values tend to be instilled into their children from an early age.

Most, but not all, Kmekh speak Kankhri.
